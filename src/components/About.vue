                <p>I'm a software developer from Canada's west-coast with extensive experience building and maintaining web applications using modern frameworks and technology. Prior to entering the industry, I owned and operated a brick-and-mortar small business servicing local consumers. Switching gears (and career paths!) in 2014, I moved on the goal of combining a fanatic pursuit of continuous improvement and a strong passion for leveraging technology to solve problems.</p>

                <p>In my time as a professional developer, I've had the opportunity to create rich interfaces with the latest technologies, build data-driven applications at scale, and explore (and re-explore) today's best practises, patterns and methodologies for developing software-- frequently traversing departmental borders to pursue a clearer picture of organizational goals and how my work can produce value.</p>

                <p>What I find most rewarding is the ability to effect change and help others, whether that takes shape as assisting a fellow code-slinger with a tricky problem, sharing my career experiences with students and new graduates, providing robust solutions to increase the bottom line, or wielding a keyboard and terminal to provide someone (or a lot of someones!) with solutions to make their life <em>just a little bit simpler.</em></p>

                <p>If you'd like to chat about an idea, a project, or simply ask me a question, please feel free to <router-link to="/contact">contact me</router-link>.</p>
